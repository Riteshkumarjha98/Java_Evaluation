Question 1:

Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write some
of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.


Ans:
 The key benefit of keeping java in immutable are caching and security synchronizing , and performance.
 The difference between String and String Builder is that String is immutable and String Builder is mutable. An immutable object is
 an object whose content cannot be changed after it is created.


1.The String class is in System namespace where as String Builder is in System.Text namespace.
2.The string created using String class is immutable where as string created using String Builder is mutable.
3.Slow as compared to String Builder where as String Builder is fast as compared to String.
4. In String class Thread-Safe where as in String Builder Thread is not Safe.
5.object of String is read-only in nature where as object of string Builder is dynamic in nature.


Java String Method :-
Concat();
Compare();
equals();
formats();
matches();
split();
